# Simple PDF Merger
## Description
This is a very basic PDF merger and transformer (GUI) I made for personal use.
It allows you to merge or rotate whole PDF-files or only parts of it.
## How to use
On windows, the easiest way is to just download the latest .exe-file in the release section and run it. 
You can also run the main.py-file directly using python, but then you'll need both the 'pypdf' and the 'ttkbootstrap' library (you can get them with 'pip install ...' in the terminal).
