# Simple PDF Merger
## Description
This is a very basic PDF merger I made for personal use.
## How to use
On windows the easiest way is to just download the .exe-file in the release section and run it. 
You can also run the python-files directly using python, but then you'll need both the 'pypdf' and the 'ttkbootstrap' library (you can get them with 'pip install ...').
